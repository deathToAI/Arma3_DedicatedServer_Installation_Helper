# Arma 3 Installation Script for Linux hosted dedicated servers

This software was developed with the purpose of making the install and basic configuring of an Arma 3(with or without mods) a little bit more intuitive.

The step by step i followed was in this three part tutorial:

**1. [Part 1: Getting Started ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iq-s9xXTEMs&t=2s)**

**2. [Part 2: Server configuration ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZq_uFi7o3s)**

**3. [Part 3: Steam workshop mods ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA89e6VJ63M)**


**I'm, in no way, associated with the author of this video**, it just helped me a lot when i was hours into trying to configure the server with no success.

# Install and use

You just need to download the shellscript and run it, sudo or root permissions may be needed as it may need to install curl,steamcmd or edit services in systemd. 

`git clone https://github.com/deathToAI/Arma3_DedicatedServer_Installation_Helper.git` 

It will present you with options (see image below), and you can select one.

# Improvements

The entire code is free to use and modify as you see fit.

**I’m not a professional programmer**, I just like tech stuff and gaming, so if you see a way to improve it, make a pull request, and I’ll be happy to be in touch and consider changes.

>Simple does it.
